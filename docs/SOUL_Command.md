### The `soul` command-line tool

This folder contains builds of the command (find it in the `soul_command` folder) lets you compile, play, and render soul code, and generate C++ and HEART code from it!

  SOUL toolkit version 0.0.1
  Library version 0.8.0
  Build date: Apr 20 2020 18:36:21

Usage:

 soul help [command]                    Shows the list of commands, or gives details about a particular command
 soul version                           Prints the current version number
 soul play [--block-size=<size>] [--rate=<sample-rate>] [--nogui] <file or folder to watch>
                                        Watches for changes to a SOUL file or folder and plays it back, either locally or remotely
 soul render --length=<samples> --output=<target file> [--input=<source audio file>] [--rate=<sample-rate>] <soul file>
                                        Runs a SOUL program, reading and rendering its input and output to audio files
 soul errors <soul file> [--testToRun=N] [--runDisabled]
                                        Does a dry-run of compiling a SOUL file and outputs any errors encountered
 soul generate [--cpp] [--wasm] [--heart] [--juce] [--juce-header] [--juce-cpp] [--graph] [--output=<output file/folder>] <soul file>
                                        Compiles a SOUL file and generates equivalent code in another target format such as C++ or WASM. The --juce option will create a folder containing a complete JUCE project which implements a patch as pure C++. The --juce-header and --juce-cpp options let you selectively create the C++ declarations and definitions for a juce plugin class.
 soul create new_patch_name [--synth] [--effect] [--output=<output folder>]
                                        Creates a patch manifest file and the boilerplate for a processor.
```
### `soul play`

To play some sound, probably the best start is to point it at the example `.soul` or `.soulpatch` files in the examples folder. 

..and then you can either run one like this:

`soul play ~/mystuff/SOUL/examples/ClassicRingtone.soul`

or leave it watching the entire folder for changes like this:

`soul play ~/mystuff/SOUL/examples`

..which means that as soon as you save a change to one of the files in there, it'll re-compile and play it, so you can tinker around with changes to the code. This is how we've been using it for things like our public demos.

### `soul generate`

The `generate` function can take a `.soul` or `.soulpatch` file and translate to C++ or show the HEART intermediate code that is used internally.

The `--cpp` options generates a dependency-free C++ class which implements the given SOUL patch. It has methods that can be used to read and write to its input and output endpoints at a low-level, and also a higher-level audio/MIDI rendering function that can process audio in a more familiar "process" style function.

The `--juce` option will create a folder (set its location with `--output=<path>`) containing a ready-to-go JUCE C++ project which can be used to build native VST/AU/AAX plugins. You should be able to simply open the generated `.jucer` file using the Projucer, and build/customise it as you would a normal JUCE plugin project.

The `--wasm` option will emit a chunk of WASM that implements the given patch.

The `--graph` option will also create a chunk of HTML which displays a visual representation of the soul processor's topology.

### `soul errors`

If you use the `soul errors` command, it'll do a dry-run compilation of a file and spit out any errors, so you can use this in an IDE to get it to report errors and jump to the offending line.

We've been using this in Atom and VScode.

A VSCode `tasks.json` file might look like this:

```
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build soul",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "soul errors ${file}",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "always",
                "panel": "new"
            },
            "problemMatcher": {
                "owner": "soul",
                "fileLocation": [
                    "absolute"
                ],
                "pattern": [
                    {
                        "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$",
                        "file": 1,
                        "line": 2,
                        "column": 3,
                        "severity": 4,
                        "message": 5
                    }
                ]
            },
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

In Atom, here's a simple `.atom-build.yaml`

```
cmd: "soul errors {FILE_ACTIVE}"
name: SOUL
errorMatch: (?<file>[\\/0-9a-zA-Z-\\._]+):(?<line>\d+):(?<col>\d+):\s*error:\s*(?<message>.+)
```

We'll find a neater way of delivering support for IDEs soon, as well as some SOUL syntax highlighting support.

### `soul create`

This command will generate the necessary boilerplate files for creating a SOUL Patch as either an effect or a synth.

### `soul render`

The render function will compile and render the output of a soul program to an audio file.
